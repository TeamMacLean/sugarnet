  <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3> What should my data file look like?</h3>

  <p>You will need to prepare a file of gene expression values from some experiment such as an RNA-Seq or microarray.
    The
    file should have at least one column of unique IDs for genes/probes and multiple columns for data. The first row
    should have headers denoting the contents of the column, the headers don't have to follow any particular convention.
    E.G <img sec="/img/example.png"></p>
  <p>The column `gene_id` contains unique IDs, `tracking_id` is a second alternative naming scheme and the rest are data
    columns. The header indicates a unique treatment/sample name for the column.</p>

  <p>The file must be saved as a `.csv` (comma separated value) file, which you can create in Excel. This means you
    mustn't
    use commas in your data file, anywhere!</p>

  <h3> Can I name my headers anything?</h3>

  <p>Yes. But don't use commas. Also try just to use numbers, letters of the alphabet and the underscore (`_`) character
    in
    names, to make it as readable by any program as possible.</p>

  <h3> Are missing data allowed?</h3>

  <p>You can specify a missing data point in a column by using `NA` in the cell in place of the number.</p>

  <p>You can also tell PINet to ignore columns of data in the interface by selecting the column as `UNUSED`.</p>
